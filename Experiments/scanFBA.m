%% Scans the FBA dataset, returning metadata about student auditions. 
% CL@GTCMT 2015
% Metadata is returned in the form of a struct, audition_metadata, which is
% described below.
%
%                         %%%% Input %%%%
% fba_relative_path: string, the relative path from the /predictive_models
%                    directory to the FBA2013 directory containing audio 
%                    files in your computer's file system.
% band_option:       string specifying the band: 'middle', 'concert' 
%                    or 'symphonic'
% instrument_option: string specifying instrument as it appears in the xls
% segment_option: N*1 int vector, specify your target segments, ex: [3; 5]
%
%                         %%%% Output %%%%
% Fields of audition_metadata:
%   file_paths: string, the path to each audio file for a student.
%   segments: N*1 cell vector, each cell is a m*2 matrix,
%             1st column = starting time, 2nd column = duration.
%   assessments: N*1 cell vector, each cell is a F*G vector
%                N -> student_id's, F -> segment, G -> category (all 26).
%                For segment and category indices, see /FBA/README.txt.
%                Segments returned in order specified by segment_option.
%   score: TODO(Yujia)
%
% file_paths, segments, and assessments have the same index for a given
% student.
%Modifications by Jyoti Narang
%The function has been modified to get audio files and their annotated
%segment files to apply ML algorithms to them for boundary
%detection.Assessments and score computations are not required for this
%problem statement.
